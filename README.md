# Racing-game

This game allows you to input the number of racers and their names. Each racer will move a random distance between 1 and 3 units in each turn. The first racer to reach or exceed the position 20 wins the race. The game will keep updating and displaying the positions of each racer until there is a winner.

You can run this code in a Java IDE or compile and execute it using the command line. Have fun racing!
